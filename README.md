<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<h2>Satanism/Pastafarianism game represented through code and logic-based puzzle algorithm</h2>
<h2>Project Code-name: "Fall Guy" dedicated to Jen Hughes (Idea provided by Satan).</h2>

<p>AGUCPLSMTHGIV- (Representative of genetic code)</p>

<h1>GREAT TRUTH!!!!!!!</h1>
<h2>"If the genetic code were Open-Sourced on Github, it could have the power to stop all wars" (Please ask me how!)</h2>

<h2>MODELS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Build in VW</li>
    <li>A-Z (to start)</li>
    <li>Add Numbers Later</li>
    <li>Add Symbols later (How many????)</li>
    <li>Does QWERTY come into play????</li>
    <li>How much of this work is already done?????</li>
</ol>

<h3>Models will take forever :-(</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>(Models are letters to start with if dropped from space, which would hit the ground first)</li>
        <li>(Second batch of models are numbers)</li>
        <li>(Third batch if models are symbols)</li>
    </ol>

<h2>USER STORIES</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The user should enter 2 sets strings of 3 initials, the formula should return:</li>
        <li>Which set is heavier</li>
        <li>A set of 6 Numbers</li>
        <li>A set of 256 characters</li>
    </ol>

<h3>Jump off the top of the platform from space, build up to terminal velocity and see who lands first ("Fall Guy Scenario") - GAME Part</h3>


<h2>Steps</h2>
<p<>Each letter needs a value based on the model... (This should be windspeed of the object falling @ terminal velocity compared to the next object) <-----NOTE Figuring out this part is the biggest hurdle</p>
        <ol>
            <li>3D Model Each Letter (symbol) Using Vectorworks</li>
            <li>Find formula to determine windspeed of object falling <---NOTE This is tricky (Animation in VW, Maybe????) <---NOTE (ET) probably knows how to solve this problem</li>
            <li>Assign number value to letter's key-value pairs</li>
            <li>Loop over str1 & str2 to determine which item is heavier (higher number value should equal heavier object)</li>
            <li>Heavier object wins <------- End of step one</li>
        <h3>Questions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to return 6-digit numerical value based on combined string?</li>
                <li>How to return 256-digit numerical value based on initials entered?</li>
            </ol>

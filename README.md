OVERVIEW
-Satanism/Pastafarianism game represented through code and logic-based puzzle algorithm
-Project Code-name: "Fall Guy" dedicated to Jen Hughes (Idea provided by Satan).

B2RBG- (Representative of genetic code)

GREAT TRUTH!!!!!!!
-"If the genetic code were Open-Sourced on Github, it could have the power to stop all wars" (Please ask me how!)

MODELS
-Build in VW
-A-Z (to start)
-Add Numbers Later
-Add Symbols later (How many????)
-Does QWERTY come into play????
-How much of this work is already done?????

Models will take forever :-(
    -(Models are letters to start with if dropped from space, which would hit the ground first)
    -(Second batch of models are numbers)
    -(Third batch if models are symbols)

USER STORIES
-The user should enter 2 sets strings of 3 initials, the formula should return:
-Which set is heavier
-A set of 6 Numbers
-A set of 256 characters


-Jump off the top of the platform from space, build up to terminal velocity and see who lands first ("Fall Guy Scenario") - GAME Part


Steps
-Each letter needs a value based on the model... (This should be windspeed of the obeject falling @ terminal velocity compared to the next object) <-----NOTE Figuring out this    part is the biggest hurdle
        -3D Model Each Letter Using Vectorworks
        -Find formula to determine windspeed of object falling <---NOTE This is tricky (Animation in VW, Maybe????) <---NOTE (ET) probably knows how to solve this problem
        -Assign number value to letter's key-value pairs
        -Loop over str1 & str2 to determine which item is heavier (higher number value should equal heavier object)
        -Heavier object wins <------- End of step one

        Questions
            -How to return 6-digit numerical value based on combined string?
            -How to return 256-digit numerical value based on initials entered?
